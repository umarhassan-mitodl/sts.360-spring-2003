Warm-up Exercises (During Sessions #1 and #2)
---------------------------------------------

1.  Do a genealogy
    *   death/cause/age
    *   education/occuptation(s)
    *   place of birth/upbringing/current location  
        
2.  Read Geert'z "Deep Play"- do a similar analysis of any of the following
    *   a sports event;
    *   a classroom;
    *   a lab;
    *   a political event (look at Geertz's book Negara);
    *   a conference  
          
        consider: social structure (alliances, factions, interest groups), psychic overinvestments (obsessions, fantasies, desires, utopias/dystopias), passion (competitions, politesse, testing boundaries between animal passion and social masques), moral idioms (mythologies, cosmologies, symbolism)  
        
3.  Read a recent science play, e.g. Roald Hoffmann and Carl Djerassi's _Oxygen_, or David Auburn's _Proof_ â€” think about conflicts of points of view (not just assignments of credit).  
    
4.  Read Dumit's "A Pharmaceutical Grammar" and do a similar analysis of another body of scientific, technical, or medical advertising.
